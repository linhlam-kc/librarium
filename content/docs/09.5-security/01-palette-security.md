# Palette Security

Spectro Cloud has security controls that ensure data protection at the management platform level, the tenant cluster level, and in SaaS operation. Security controls are in place throughout Spectro Cloud's infrastructure.

In self-managed operation, where Palette is typically deployed on-prem behind a firewall, you must ensure security controls in your environment. Find more about on-prem deployment in [Self-Managed Operation](/security/self-managed-operation).
