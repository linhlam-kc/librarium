# Overview

Cluster Autoscalar is a feature of Palette that allows you to delegate the management of scaling cluster worker nodes to Palette. 
Clusters with the cluster autoscalar feature enabled will automatically receive adjustments in the number of active worker nodes in the cluster to match the current workload.

When there are not enough nodes to handle the incoming traffic or workloads, the cluster autoscaler will add new nodes to the cluster. The additional nodes will ensures there are enough resources available to handle the increase workload.

In situations when there are too many nodes in the cluster as a result of decrease in the workload. The autoscaler will remove the nodes that are not needed, reducing unnecessary costs and optimizing resource utilization.

The cluster autoscaler dynamically scales the number of nodes in a cluster based on the actual workload, ensuring that the cluster is always right-sized for the current demand.
