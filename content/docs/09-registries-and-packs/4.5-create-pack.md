# Create and Deploy a Custom Add-On Pack
Custom add-on packs enable running desired Kubernetes applications in clusters and reusing them in multiple deployments, ensuring uniformity across the infrastructure. The primary use cases for creating custom packs are:
<br />

- Aggregate all required configuration and application dependencies for simplified deployment and consumption.

- Open-source contributors can add new Kubernetes applications to a custom add-on pack for the community.

- Enterprises can add proprietary Kubernetes applications to a custom add-on pack.

In this tutorial, you will create a custom add-on pack to package a sample Kubernetes application, [Hello Universe](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe#hello-universe), and deploy that application to a cluster. You will learn to create the pack in two ways, using the manifest files and helm charts. 

After defining the custom pack, you will set up a registry server, publish the pack to that registry, and configure the registry server in the Palette console from where you can access the pack directly into your Profile. Lastly, you will create a Profile and deploy it to a cluster using either Palette console or Terraform. 


# Prerequisites
To follow the current tutorial, you will need the following items:
- Spectro Cloud account and familiarity with creating and deploying a profile to a cluster in the Palette console. 
- Tenant admin access to Palette to add the new registry server.
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your local machine to run the "tutorials" container. 
- Basic knowledge of Docker containers and Kubernetes manifest file attributes.




# Set up the Tutorial Environment
You will work in a Docker container pre-configured with the necessary tools for this tutorial. However, you can practice this tutorial in any other environment having  `linux/amd64` or `x86_64` processor architecture, installing the [necessary tools](https://github.com/spectrocloud/tutorials/blob/main/docs/docker.md#docker), and cloning the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/spectrocloud/tutorials/) containing the tutorial files. Here are the steps to start the "tutorials" container. 

  - Start the Docker Desktop on your local machine and ensure that the daemon is running by running a sample command to list the running containers.

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

  - Download the "tutorials" image to your local machine.

  ```bash
  docker pull ghcr.io/spectrocloud/tutorials:1.0.2
  ```

  - The Docker image includes the necessary tools. Next, start and open the bash in the container.

  ```bash
  docker run --name tutorialContainer --publish 7000:5000 --interactive --tty ghcr.io/spectrocloud/tutorials:1.0.2 bash
  ```

  If the port 7000 on your local machine is unavailable, you can use any other port of your choice. 
  <br /> 

  <InfoBox>
  Wait to exit the container until the tutorial is complete. Otherwise, you may lose your progress. 
  </InfoBox>

  <br /> <br />


## Tools and Starter Code
After opening the bash in the running container, verify that the tools necessary for this tutorial are installed already. 

  - Check the Spectro CLI version.

  ```bash
  spectro version
  ```

  - Check the Specktro registry server version.

  ```bash
  registry --version
  ```

  - Check Terraform version.

  ```bash
  terraform --version
  ```

  In addition to the tools above, the "tutorials" container has other tools, such as `ngrok`, `git`, and `nano`. 
  
  - Have a look at the directories relevant to the current tutorial in the **root** directory. 

  ```bash
  .
  ├── packs
  │   └── hello-universe-pack             # Contains the pack files
  └── terraform
      └── pack-tf                         # Contains the .tf files for creating Spectro Cloud resources
  ```
  The **pack** directory contains the pack files, whereas the **terraform** directory contains the Terraform files for creating Spectro Cloud resources, which we will utilize in the latter half of this tutorial.

<br /> <br />

# Build a Pack

Building a custom pack requires defining specific files. 
As outlined in the [Adding Add-on Packs](/registries-and-packs/adding-add-on-packs), you can define a custom pack in two ways, either using manifest files or helm charts. Accordingly, the file structure varies for manifest-based packs and helm chart-based packs. Here is the reference file structure:
<br />

<Tabs>

<Tabs.TabPane tab="Manifests-based pack" key="add_on_packs_manifests">

```bash
.

</Tabs.TabPane>


</Tabs>

<br /> <br />

To simplify this tutorial, we have provided you with the manifest file for the *hello-universe* application in the **packs/hello-universe-pack** sub-directory.
<br />

```bash
cd packs/hello-universe-pack
```
Ensure you have the following files in the current directory.
<br />

```bash
.
├── pack.json           # mandatory
├── values.yaml         # mandatory
├── manifests           # mandatory
│   └── hello-universe.yaml
├── logo.png            # mandatory
└── README.md           # Optional
```
<br /> <br />

## Pack File Structure

Let's take a look at each file in the pack.
<br />

1. **pack.json** -  This file contains the pack metadata, such as `addonType`, `cloudTypes`, `kubeManifests` array containing the list of manifest files, `layer`, `name`, and `version`. Refer to the JSON Schema defined [here](/registries-and-packs/add-custom-packs) for a list of potential properties and respective descriptions. 

  <br /> 

  ```json
  {
      "addonType":"app services",
      "cloudTypes": [ "all" ],
      "displayName": "Hello Universe",
      "kubeManifests": [
          "manifests/hello-universe.yaml"
      ],
      "layer": "addon",
      "name": "hellouniverse",
      "version": "1.0.0"
  }
  ```
  
  <br />



2. **values.yaml** -  This file contains configurable parameters you can define while adding the current pack to a profile in the Palette console. In addition, you can optionally define *presets*, the predefined values to use in the **values.yaml**, in a separate **presets.yaml** file. The presets will become available during the profile creation and cluster deployment. Presets make the parameter configuration effortless and less error-prone by avoiding "manual" editing of the **values.yaml** file. Refer  
[here](/registries-and-packs/pack-constraints) for more details and examples on defining *presets*. 

  In the **values.yaml** file for this tutorial, the `pack/namespace` attribute specifies the namespace on the target cluster to deploy the pack. If the namespace is not found, Palette will create a new namespace with the name specified. 
  
  The `manifests` section exposes the configurable parameters for each manifest file in the *manifests/* directory. For example, in the sample code snippet below, the `hello-universe` attribute exposes the `registry`, `repository`, and `tag` parameters. <br /> <br />

  <br />

  ```yaml
  pack:
      namespace: "hello-universe"
  manifests:
      hello-universe:
          registry: ghcr.io
          repository: spectrocloud/hello-universe
          tag: 1.0.10
  ```

  <br />

  For example, the visual below shows the **values.yaml** file's configurable parameters for the `hello-universe` manifest during the profile creation. 

  <br /> <br />

  ![Visual of the configurable parameters in the values.yaml file.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_profile-values-yaml.png )

  <br /> <br />

  <InfoBox>

  For Helm chart-based packs, you can validate chart values by defining the [JSON schema](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#schema-files) in the **values.schema.json** file to validate the parameter values in the **values.yaml** file. Once you have defined the schema, you can use the `helm lint` command to validate the schema against the values in **values.yaml**. 

  </InfoBox>
  <br />

3. **manifests** -  This directory contains the manifest files for your Kubernetes application. This tutorial has only one file, **hello-universe.yaml**. Note that the **values.yaml** file has a corresponding `manifests/hello-universe` element with the same name as the YAML file. 
  <br />

4. **logo.png** -  This file has a logo that the Palette console will display during the profile creation.  
<br />


5. **README.md** -  This optional file may contain the pack description, purpose, authors, and other relevant information. In this tutorial, we have used a minimal README outlining the application used in the pack.
<br />


After finalizing all mandatory files in the pack directory, the next step is to set up a registry server and publish the pack to that registry, from where you can access it directly into your Palette console. 

<br /> <br />

# Set Up the Registry Server

## Start the Registry Server

The "tutorials" environment already has the Specktro registry service available. 

  - Start the registry server by running the following command in the bash into the "tutorials" container. 

  ```bash
  registry serve /etc/spectro/config.yml > /var/log/registry.log 2>&1 &
  ```

  The registry server will start in HTTP mode (not HTTPS). Refer to the [Add a Custom Registry](/registries-and-packs/adding-a-custom-registry) to know more about deploying an HTTPS registry server. 


  - Next, expose the registry server to the public so that you can configure the registry server in Palette later. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) reverse proxy to expose the registry server listening on port 5000 via an HTTP tunnel using the following command. 

  ```bash
  ngrok http 5000 --log-level debug
  ```

  The visual below shows the registry server successfully exposed via ngrok. 

  <br /> <br />

  ![Visual of registry server exposed via ngrok](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_ngrok-start.png )

  <br /> <br />



Verify if the registry server is accessible from outside the "tutorials" container by making a request to the `/health` endpoint. For example, access the *https://3735-106-215-88-147.ngrok-free.app/health*, in the host browser. You should receive a `{"status":"UP"}` response.

<br /> <br />

## Login to the Registry Server 
The credentials to log in to the registry server are:

```bash
username: admin
password: admin
```

  - Open another bash session in the "tutorials" container. 
  
  ```bash
  docker exec -it tutorialContainer bash
  ```

  - Login to the registry server using the ngrok's public URL, *similar* to the command below. Change the URL as applicable to you. You must receive a `Login Succeeded` response. 

  ```bash
  spectro registry login f59e-49-36-220-143.ngrok-free.app --insecure --default -u admin -p admin
  ```

  <br />

  <WarningBox>
  Do not use https:// or http:// keyword in the ngrok URL; otherwise, you will encounter an authorization issue. 
  </WarningBox>

<br /> <br />

## Push the Pack to the Registry Server
Push the pack to the registry using the following command. 
<br />

```bash
spectro pack push /packs/hello-universe-pack/
```
After pushing the pack, you list all packs using the following command. 

```bash
spectro pack ls
```

Ensure that the last command above displays the pack you pushed, as shown in the visual below.  

<br /> <br />

![Visual of spectro pack ls](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_pack-push.png)

<br /> <br />


If you want to modify it further, change the pack version in the **pack.json** file and push it again to the registry server. However, if you need to delete a pack, you can do so by running the following command:
<br />

```bash
spectro pack tag delete hellouniverse:1.0.0
```



After pushing the pack, configure the registry server in the Palette console so that you can access the pack in the Palette.  
<br /> <br />


## Configure the Registry Server in the Palette Console
Log into the Palette console, switch to the Tenant admin view, and follow these steps: 


- As a Tenant admin, navigate to **Admin Settings &#8594; Registries &#8594; Pack Registries**.


- Click the **Add New Pack Registry** and enter the pack registry name, endpoint, and user credentials. For a consistent experience in this tutorial, we have chosen the name **private-pack-registry**, as shown in the visual below. Though you can choose any other name per your organization's naming convention. 

<br /> <br />


![Visual of registry server edit option in Palette Tenant admin settings.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_registry-edit.png)

<br /> <br />


- Click on **Confirm**. The Palettle syncs the registry server periodically. However, you can sync it manually by clicking the **Three Dots** against the registry server name and selecting the **Sync now** option.  

<br /> <br />

![Visual of registry server sync in the Palette](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_registry-sync.png)

<br /> <br />



# Create a Profile and Deploy a Cluster
After configuring the registry server in Palette, create a Profile and deploy it to a cluster using either of the following two methods:
<br /> 

1. Using the **Palette console**.
<br /> 

2. Using **Terraform code**.
<br />

As part of this tutorial, you will create a Profile for the AWS cloud service provider. However, you can choose any other cloud service provider, provided the following two items are configured in the Palette console.:
<br /> 

1. **Cloud account**: A cloud account added to your Palette project settings. This tutorial assumes the AWS cloud account name is **spectro-cloud**. The below visual shows how to add and verify a cloud account to your project by navigating to **Project Settings  &#8594; Cloud Accounts  &#8594; AWS  &#8594; Add AWS Account** in the Palette console. 


<br /> <br />

![Visual of Cloud Accounts in the Palette console.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_palette-cloud-account.png)

<br /> <br />


2. **SSH key**: An SSH key created in the region where you will deploy the cluster. This tutorial will deploy the cluster in the **us-east-2** region and assumes an SSH key, **aws_key_sk_us_east_2**, already in the AWS console. You can create an SSH key with any name of your choice in the AWS portal. 

<br /> <br />

## Create a Profile
Switch to the **Default** view and select the **Profile** section in the left **Main Menu** to create a full profile that combines core infrastructure and add-on layers. Click on the **Add Cluster Profile** button, and provide the details in the wizard that follows. The wizard will present you with several sections. 
<br />

### Section: Basic Information
Use the following values in the first section, **Basic Information**. 

|**Field**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|Name|*pack-tutorial-profile*|
|Version|`1.0.0`|
|Description|*Cluster profile as part of the pack tutorial.*|
|Type|*Full*|
|Tags|`spectro-cloud-education, app:hello-universe, terraform_managed:true`|

<br />

### Section: Cloud Type
In the next section, **Cloud Type**, choose AWS as the infrastructure provider for this tutorial (for a consistent experience). If you choose any other cloud service provider, the core infrastructure layers options, as outlined in the table below, will differ from this tutorial. 

<br />

### Section: Profile Layers
In the **Profile Layers** section, add the following core infrastructure layers:

|**Pack Type**|**Registry**|**Pack Name**|**Pack Version**| 
|---|---|---|---|
|OS|Public Repo|Ubuntu|`LTS__20.4.x`|
|Kubernetes|Public Repo|Kubernetes|`1.24.x`|
|Network|Public Repo|Calico|`3.25.x`|
|Storage|Public Repo|Amazon EBS CSI|`1.16.x`|

Once you confirm adding the core infrastructure layers, click the **Add New Pack** button to add the following layers (including the custom add-on pack you defined and pushed to the registry). 

|**Pack Type**|**Registry**|**Pack Name**|**Pack Version**| 
|---|---|---|---|
|Authentication | Public Repo| Spectro Proxy | `1.3.x`|
| App Services | **private-pack-registry** | **Hello Universe** | `1.0.x` |

Note that the values, **private-pack-registry** and the **Hello Universe**, may vary if you have chosen a different name for your registry and pack, respectively. 


<br /> <br />

![Visual of the Profile Layers success.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_profile-layer.png)

<br /> <br />


### Section: Review
Lastly, review and finish creating the profile configuration. You would see the newly created profile if there were no errors or compatibility issues between the individual layers. 

<br /> <br />

## Create a Cluster
View the details of the profile you just created, and click the **Deploy** button on the top right to create a new cluster. The cluster creation wizard will present you with the a few sections. 
<br />

### Section: Basic Information
Use the following values in the first section, **Basic Information**. 

|**Field**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|Cluster name| *pack-tutorial-cluster* |
|Description| *Cluster as part of the pack tutorial.*|
|Tags|`spectro-cloud-education, app:hello-universe, terraform_managed:true`|
|Cloud Account|**spectro-cloud**|

Note that the value **spectro-cloud** is the AWS cloud account name already configured in the Palette project settings. 

<br /> <br />

### Section: Parameters
Next, the **Parameters** section allows you to change the profile configurations. For example, clicking on the **Hello Universe 1.0.x** layer will allow you to configure the `registry`, `repository`, and `tag` parameters defined in the **values.yaml** file. Let's keep those parameter values as default and move to the next section. 

<br /> <br />

### Section: Cluster config
In the **Cluster config** section, uncheck the **Static Placement** field, select the **us-east-2** region, and select the SSH key pair name you have in your AWS console. If checked, the **Static Placement** will deploy the cluster in an existing VPC, subnets, roles, and other resources. But, for this tutorial, you will choose the dynamic placement, meaning the Palette dev engine will create a new VPC and all other resources needed for the cluster. 

<br /> <br />

### Section: Nodes config
In the **Nodes config** section, provide the details for the master and the worker pool. For learning purposes, you can use the following configuration:

|**Field** | **Value for the master-pool**| **Value for the worker-pool**|
|---| --- | ---|
|Node pool name| *master-pool* | *worker-pool* |
|Number of nodes in the pool| `1` | `1` |
|Allow worker capability| *Checked* | Not applicable |
|Enable Autoscaler | Not applicable | No |
|Rolling update |  Not applicable | *Expand* <br /> Launch a new node first, then shut down the old one. |
|Instance Type | General purpose `m4.large` | Copy from Master pool | 
|Availability zones | **us-east-2a** <br />Choose only one availability zone. | Copy from Master pool | 
|Disk size | 60 GiB | Copy from Master pool | 

<br /> <br />

### Section: Settings and Review
Use the default values in the **Settings** section and review all configurations in the **Review** section.  If everything looks good, finish creating the cluster configuration. It will start deploying the cluster and may take up to 15-20 minutes to finish.

<br /> <br />

![Visual of the cluster health.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_cluster-health.png)

<br /> <br />

You can also look at real-time metrics on the **Overview** tab, such as CPU and memory consumption. 

<br /> <br />

## Validate

After the Palette finishes provisioning the cluster, the status will turn to **Running** and **Healthy**. You can access the application on the exposed port 8080 for the **Hello Universe** service. The application will look similar to the visual below. 


<br /> <br />

![Visual of the successful accessing the application using the load balancer URL.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_success.png)

<br /> <br />

Congratulations, you've successfully deployed the *Hello Universe* application to the cluster. 

<br /> <br />

## Cleanup

Delete the cluster and the profile by navigating to the **Cluster** and **Profile** sections in the left **Main Menu**, respectively. 

<br /> <br />

![Visual of deleting the cluster in the Palette console.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_delete-cluster.png)

<br /> <br />

Delete the cluster before deleting the profile. 
<br /> <br />


![Visual of deleting the profile in the Palette console.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_delete-profile.png)

<br /> <br />




Wait for the resources to clean up and ensure the successful resource deletion in the Palette console. 

</Tabs.TabPane>


<Tabs.TabPane tab="Terraform Code" key="Terraform_Code">



The [Spectro Cloud Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) allows the creation and management of Palette resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which has several advantages, such as automating infrastructure, facilitating collaboration, documenting infrastructure, and keeping all infrastructure in a single source of truth.

## Starter Code
Let's switch back to the "tutorials" container, where you will find the starter Terraform files. If you have closed the terminal session, you can reopen another bash session in the "tutorials" container. 
<br />

```bash
docker exec -it tutorialContainer bash
```

Change to the **terraform/pack-tf** directory containing the Terraform code for this tutorial. 
<br />

```bash
cd terraform/pack-tf
```

## Set up the Spectro Cloud API key

Before you can get started with the Terraform code, you need a Spectro Cloud API key which will help authenticate the Spectro Cloud Terraform provider to the Palette. To add a new API key, log in to Palette, click on the user **User Menu** on the top-right corner, and select **My API Keys**, as shown in the visual below. 

<br /> <br />

![Visual of generating an API key in the Palette.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_generate-api-key.png )

<br /> <br />

Here are the steps to follow next:
<br />

1. Fill in the required fields, such as the API key name and expiration date, and confirm to create the key. 
<br />

2. Copy the key value to your clipboard, and switch back to the "tutorials" container environment. 
<br />

3. Export the API key as an environment variable so the Spectro Terraform Cloud provider can authenticate with the Palette API.
<br />

  ```bash
  export SPECTROCLOUD_APIKEY=<Your-Spectro-Cloud-API-key>
  ```
<br /> <br />

## Review Terraform Files
Ensure that you have the following files in the current working directory.
<br />

```bash
.
├── Profile.tf		# Resource
├── cluster.tf		# Resource
├── data.tf			# Spectro Cloud data resources
├── inputs.tf		# Input varibales
├── outputs.tf		# Output variables
└── provider.tf		# Spectro Cloud Terraform provider 
```
We strongly recommend that you review and explore all Terraform files. Here is a high-level overview of each file:


-  **Profile.tf** - has the configuration for creating a Profile resource. 


-  **cluster.tf** - has the configuration for creating a cluster in AWS. The cluster resource depends upon the Profile resource. 


- **data.tf** - contains the resources to retrieve data from Palette dynamically.


- **inputs.tf** - contains all the Terraform variables and the default values used in the tutorial. Before running the terraform commands, watch for the `# ToDo` tags against the fields you want to update. 

- **outputs.tf** - contains the output variables to expose information.


- **provider.tf** - contains the provider configuration and version.

<br /> <br />

## Deploy Terraform
After carefully reviewing the Terraform files, initialize the Terraform provider:
<br />

```bash
terraform init
```

The `init` command above will download plugins and providers from the **provider.tf** file. Next, preview the resources Terraform will create. 
<br />

```bash
terraform plan
```

The output displays the resources Terraform will create in an actual implementation. Lastly, finish creating all resources using the following command. 
<br />

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

It will take up to 20 mins to provision a cluster. See a sample successful deplyment in the visual below. 
While the deployment is in progress, you can switch to the Palette to validate the in-progress deployment. 

<br /> <br />


## Check the In-Progress Deployment
Log back into the [Palette console](https://console.spectrocloud.com/), and navigate to the **Profile** section in the left **Main Menu**. If the terraform deployment is successful, you will see the newly created Profile, as shown in the visual below. 

<br /> <br />

![Visual of the successful Profile in the Palette console.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_verify-profile.png)

<br /> <br />



<br /> <br />

## Validate

Navigate to the **Clusters** section in the Palette console's left **Main Menu** and view the cluster deployment in progress. After the Palette finishes provisioning the cluster, the status will turn to **Running** and **Healthy**. You can access the application on the exposed port 8080 for the **Hello Universe** service. 

<br /> <br />

![Visual of the cluster health.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_cluster-health.png)

<br /> <br />

The application will look similar to the visual below. 

<br /> <br />

![Visual of the successful accessing the application using the load balancer URL.](/tutorials/create-pack/registries-and-packs_create-pack_success.png)

<br /> <br />

Congratulations, you've successfully deployed the *Hello Universe* application to the cluster. 



<br /> <br />

## Cleanup

To delete the resources, switch back to the "tutorials" container, and ensure you are in the  **terraform/pack-tf** directory before running the following command:
<br />

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
<br /> 

Wait for the resources to clean up and ensure the successful resource deletion in the Palette console as well.

# Wrap-Up

In this tutorial, you created a custom add-on pack to package the *Hello Universe* application and deployed it to a cluster. First, you learned to create the pack using the manifest files. Then, along the learning journey, you learned to set up a private registry server and publish the pack to that registry. In the latter half of the tutorial, you configured the registry server in the Palette console so that you can access the pack to create a Profile. Later, you created a Profile and deployed it to a cluster using the Palette console or Terraform. 

<br /> <br />
