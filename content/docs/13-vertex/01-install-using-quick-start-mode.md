# Install Using Quick-Start Mode

Paletteâ€™s On-Prem Quick-Start Mode is a single-node installation of the Palette platform in vCenter vSphere. This installation is typically used for Proof of Concept (POC) environments to quickly understand the capabilities of the Palette platform. It is not recommended for Production deployments but serves as a precursory installation for Enterprise mode. 

For production environments, you will migrate the single-node cluster you deploy in Quick-Start mode to Enterprise mode. Enterprise mode deploys three nodes for High Availability (HA). For steps on migrating the single-node cluster, refer to the [Migrate Cluster to Enterprise Mode](/vertex-edition/migrate-cluster-to-enterprise-mode) guide.

# Prerequisites

- Downloaded platform installer Open Virtualization Application/Appliance (OVA) file using the link provided, and upload it into vCenter.


- Added port permissions to Inbound rules for Security groups for Palette connectivity and outbound connections. Refer to [Network Ports](/architecture/networking-ports/#self-hostednetworkcommunicationsandports) for a list of required ports that must enabled for inbound or outbound communication. 


- A new or existing SSH key pair to access the installer VM for any troubleshooting.
