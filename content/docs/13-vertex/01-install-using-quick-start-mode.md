# Install Using Quick-Start Mode

Paletteâ€™s On-Prem Quick-Start Mode is a single-node installation of the Palette platform in vCenter. This installation is typically used for Proof of Concept (POC) deployments to quickly understand the capabilities of the Palette platform. It is not recommended for Production deployments but serves as a precursory installation for Enterprise mode. 

For production environments, you will migrate the single-node cluster you deploy in Quick-Start mode to Enterprise mode. Enterprise mode deploys two additional nodes to create a three-node cluster for High Availability (HA). For steps on migrating the single-node cluster to Enterprise Mode, refer to the [Migrate Cluster to Enterprise Mode](/vertex-edition/migrate-cluster-to-enterprise-mode) guide.

# Prerequisites

- Downloaded platform installer Open Virtualization Appliance (OVA) file using the link provided, and upload it into vCenter.


- Added port permissions to inbound rules for security groups to provide Palette connectivity and outbound connections. Refer to [Network Ports](/architecture/networking-ports/#self-hostednetworkcommunicationsandports) for a list of required ports that must enabled for inbound or outbound communication. 


- A new or existing SSH key pair to access the platform installer for any troubleshooting.  
 
# Install Palette

The following steps will guide you to deploy the installer for your Palette platform. 

<br />

<InfoBox>

We recommend using the Chrome browser.

<br />

1. Log in to the vSphere console and navigate in the left **Main Menu** to **Datacenter** and the folder you will use for your installation.


2. Right-click on the folder and select **Deploy OVF Template**.


3. Fill out the fields listed in the table.

| **Field**               | **Description**                                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **URL**                 | The location of the platform installer.            |
| **Virtual Machine Name**| A custom name for your virtual machine.            |
| **Folder**              | The name of the folder that contains the OVF.      |

4. Select the desired Datacenter, Storage, and Network for the platform installer.

    The installer requires an outgoing internet connection. Select a network that provides this access directly or via a proxy.

    <br />

5. Fill out the remaining template customization options. You can modify the following input fields. <br /><br />

6. When you are done filling out options, click the **Finish** button. Status is displayed for **Spectro Cloud artifacts**, **Kubernetes configuration**, and **Palette installation**. Confirm these have processed successfully. Processing may take a few minutes. URLs for the Monitoring Console and the on-prem System Console will be displayed when processing is complete.

  <br />

6. Copy the URL for the **On-Prem System Console** to a new tab. A privacy notification displays. Click the **Advanced** button, then click the **Proceed** link.


7. Enter default Palette credentials and click the **Login** button. Default: **Username**: admin, **Password**: admin. 

    <br />

8. Install Palette: 

     - To install Palette Enterprise or Palette VerteX, click the **Install Now** button displayed under **Enterprise** and follow steps in the [Migrate Cluster to Enterprise Mode](/vertex-edition/migrate-cluster-to-enterprise-mode) guide.

     - To install for a POC, click the **Start Now** button under **Quick Start**.




# Validation

The platform installer contains a web application called the Supervisor, to provide detailed progress of the installation. After you power on the VM, follow the steps below to ensure the installation completed successfully.

1. Open the Supervisor application in a browser window by navigating to https://<VM IP Address>:5080.


2. Click the **Status** tab to view the installation progress. The page auto-refreshes to provide updated installation progress.

3. When the final installation step is complete, you will see URLs to navigate to the On-Prem System Console as well as the Management Console.

  - On-Prem System Console: Initial login: admin/admin

  - Management Console: Tenant credentials to be created and used Configure System for First Time.


4. Navigate to the On-Prem System Console to perform the initial configuration. Additional administration tasks like SMTP setup and certificate management can also be performed from the On-Prem System Console. Most of these are optional and can be performed at any later time.


5. To create and activate your first tenant, open the On-Prem System Console application in a browser window by navigating to https://<VM IP Address>/system.


6. Log in using username ``admin`` and password ``admin``.


7. Reset the default password.


8. When prompted, choose Quick Start for the startup mode. 


9. Navigate to the Tenant Management section and create your first tenant.


10. Copy the tenant activation link and invoke it in a browser window to activate the newly created tenant.


11. Enter the desired password and proceed and log in as a tenant into the Management Console.


# Next Steps

If you are using the installation as a POC, you can now create gateways, cloud accounts, cluster profiles, and launch clusters using the management console. [Need a link here to Clusters docs].

If you are installing for a production environment, you are ready to migrate the initial cluster you deployed to Enterprise mode. [Link here to Enterprise Mode doc].
